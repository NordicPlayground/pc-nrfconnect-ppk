## 3.1.1 - 2021-03-10

## 3.1.0 - 2021-02-15

### Added

- Split the primary view in two, a **data logger** and a **real-time** view.
    With the data logger view the user can examine the power continuously over a
    period of time. In the real-time view, which has similar functionality to an
    oscilloscope, the user can specify a trigger level, and when the consumed
    power reaches this threshold, the power consumption signature in the
    surrounding period of time can be inspected in detail.
- **Trigger**: Previously only available when using the
    [older, first version of the Power Profiler Kit hardware](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/Power-Profiler-Kit)
    now triggers can also be set when using the new
    [Power Profiler Kit II (PPK2) hardware](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/Power-Profiler-Kit-2).
- Only with the PPK2: Set a **pre or post trigger** by moving the slider above
    the graph, to decide how much time before and after the trigger is relevant
    and will be shown for the next trigger.
- Average sampling with a lower resolution: When interested in **examining
    power over a longer time span** you can lower the samples per second.
    Sampling is still done at the full resolution, but automatically averaged to
    decrease the storage size. The rate can be lowered as far as only a sample
    per second, enabling sampling for days or even months.
- Besides the existing CSV export: **Save** the current data in a format to
    **Load** it again later within the app, enabling sharing data and examining
    it at a later time.
- Easily create **screenshots** of the current graph.

### Changed

- Raise **limit for displaying digital channels** (on the highest resolution
    they were previously only shown for a time range of up to 3 seconds, now
    they are shown for up to 30 seconds).
- **Enhanced performance** to make the UI more responsive.
- Several **minor UI changes** to improve the user experience.

## 3.0.3 - 2020-12-11

    The top margin in the side panel was shrunken.

## 3.0.2 - 2020-12-11

### Fixed

- CSV export contained the wrong portion of data.

## 3.0.1 - 2020-12-03

### Fixed

- Connecting a PPK via J-Link Lite failed.
- Moving the right handle past the left handle in the chart selection would
    break the values displayed in the selection window.

## 3.0.0 - 2020-12-01

### Changed

- Complete rewrite of the application. This version supports the old power
    profiler kit, in addition to the newly released PPK2 hardware.
