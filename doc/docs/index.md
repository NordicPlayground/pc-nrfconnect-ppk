# nRF Connect Power Profiler

nRF Connect Power Profiler is an app available from [nRF Connect for Desktop](https://nordic-dev.zoominsoftware.io/bundle/nrf-connect-desktop/page/index.html) that you can use to communicate with the Power Profiler Kit II (PPK2) in order to obtain real-time current measurements of your designs.

The PPK measures current consumption for a connected Nordic Development Kit or any external board. It gives a detailed picture of the current profile for the user application.
