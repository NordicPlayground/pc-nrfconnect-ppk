# Power Profiler app

The Power Profiler app is a tool to communicate with the
[Power Profiler Kit II (PPK2)](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/Power-Profiler-Kit-2),
an affordable and flexible tool to obtain real-time current measurements of your
designs.

The PPK measures current consumption for a connected Nordic Development Kit or
any external board. It gives a detailed picture of the current profile for the
user application.
